# College Major Earnings

This repo contains data and analysis that investigates early career earnings outcomes by college major.

The analysis currently investigates questions like:
- What majors lead to the greatest earnings? 
- What majors experience higher or lower levels of employment? 
- What are the differences in how Men and Women pursue majors and how does that affect their earnings?

# To work with this analysis
- Source data is provided in 'recent-grads.csv'
- Just download the jupyter notebook and make sure it's referencing the correct file path for the data.
- The analysis utilizes very common libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.

I got inspiration for this project from a DataQuest class which provides a guided project using this dataset.

The ultimate data source is the US Census's 2010-2012 American Community Survey.
Fivethrityeight made a cleaned version of that data available here.
